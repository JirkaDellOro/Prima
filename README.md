# Prima
Repository for the module "Prototyping interactive media-applications and games" at Furtwangen University

[Pages-Version](https://jirkadelloro.github.io/Prima/)

## Examples
See the results created by the docents during the PRIMA-lectures. This is experimental material showing some core functionalities the course was working on, not fully functional prototypes. Usually, we examine one 2d and one 3d application.

- Create a README.md file in your PRIMA-Repository on Github including the following
  * Title
  * Author
  * Year and season (Summer, Winter)
  * Curriculum and semester
  * Course this development was created in (PRIMA) 
  * Docent
  - Link to the finished and executable application on Github-Pages
  - Link to the source code
  - Link to the design document
  - Description for users on how to interact
  - Description on how to install, if applicable (additional services, database etc.) 
  - A copy of the catalogue of criteria above, the right column replaced with very brief explanations and descriptions of the fullfullments of these criteria
